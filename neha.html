<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Queen Chow: Typhoon Shelter Crab</h2></span> 
<p style="font-size:160%;">It's origins are self-explanatory enough. A dish from the fishing ports of Wanchi in Hong Kong, the 'Typhoon Shelter Crab' emerged when fisherman were forced to shelter during — yep — typhoons and decided to kill time by coming up with new and inventive ways to cook their catch.</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">Queen Chow head chef Patrick Friesen says there are only two places in HK to taste the best versions of this dish. And now you can add a third to the list in Queen Chow which is along way from any Chinese fishing port, located in the newly-refurbed Merivale super pub the Queen Victoria Hotel on Enmore Road.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">“We sell about 40 of these a week which is a lot really because it's not a cheap dish," says Friesen, who uses a whopping 5 heads — or around 50 clov'es — of garlic per crab.But first the crustacean is deep-fried in vegetable oil then wok-tossed with chilli, the garlic and a mix of black and soy beans.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">"I recommend eating it with your hands, the you get this garlicky, salty crust all over your fingers which you can lick off ... oh man, it's like crack," Friesan says.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Add an ice cold Newtowner beer and get hooked.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;"><br>Bistro Guillaume: Whiting Colbert, Pomme Pont Neuf, beurre maitre d’hotel.</h2></span></br>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b83348f9a312ef4d85de7027aef67d58?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">You can thanks Sydney's record temperatures for this smash-hit dessert which Mercado head chef Nathan Sasi hatched over the Christmas break.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Looking for something lighter to cut through a dessert menu that leans to the heavy side, Sasi threw together a few of his favourite fruity ingredients and voila; the perfect summer dessert.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">"It's definitely a dish that is getting amazing traction for us at the moment," says Sasi, who starts with a meringue base which is crouched in the middle and filled with marscapone.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">He then scoops out a watermelon with a melon baller which is then vacuum packed with rosewater and sugar syrup. They're poured over the top of the meringue, sprinkled with roasted pistachios and the whole thing is served with rosewater and strawberry sorbet.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;"> Whiskey-brined pork chop</h2></span> 
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6fdea09213985f8e8c8c0a979afd6d05?width=366" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The newest of newcomers to the CBD, Eastside Grill — nestled among some impressive company at the Kensington Street food precinct — offers a relatively unique perspective; a New York-style grill with a Japanese twist.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Head chef Stanley Wong says this pork chop dish — an instant classic since opening just two weeks ago — is inspired by childhood comfort food and is made after marinating the meat in a brine that consists of bourbon, apple cider vinegar, sugar and spices.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">It is then seasoned with homemade Japanese Togarashi salt before grilled on the white charcoal. Want to go 'full' New Yorker? Order up a side of the truffle mac'n'cheese and finish with the baked cheesecake.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">The Benjamin Platter</h2></span> 
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e3e8da868e608ffd0473c03a64e23512?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">If last year's food trends were defined by honky-tonk fast food like burgers and curly fries served in quaint plastic baskets, then 2017 looks set to be the year of grown-up Americana — specifically the rise of east-coast Jewish cuisine.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The best in Sydney? The new deli Benjamin & Daughters in Double Bay where the Benjamin Platter — three types of cured salmon piled high with traditional accompaniments like bagels and cream cheese - is the sophisticated share dish that has Eastern suburbanites clamouring.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Crispy barramundi with green apple salad and caramelised pork belly</h2></span> 
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/876efb3137892755824872d9b4da6806?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">There are few restaurants that rate as highly on the anticipation scale as Chin Chin - the iconic Melbourne Thai eatery that will open its first Sydney outpost in August.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Head chef Benjamin Cooper says their famous dish of crispy barramundi with green apple salad and caramelised pork belly — their Melbourne signature — was the first thing added to the Sydney menu.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">"From day one this dish really struck a cord with our diners. It talks Thai - salty, spicy, sour, sweet. Once you try it, you just want to it eat again and again."</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Whole roasted flounder </h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/81ca5024c9a870db96fe1c2b7672da47?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">It's always nice when you find a sensational dish made with excellent (and sustainable) ingredients that also looks so damn pretty.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Head chef Justin Schott has achieved this feat at the new-look Paddington Inn where his whole flounder — laden with a zingy, hot horseradish sauce and pickled beetroots - has become a quick-fire seafood classic.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;"> Kingfish carpaccio </h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/94b0068141a1d0445cc49a2f388b96f1?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">A newcomer to Potts Point from one of the original founders of the Fratelli Fresh restaurant chain, ABC was inspired by the world-famous restaurant ABC Kitchen in New York headed up by US celebrity chef John George.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Only a few weeks old and the Sydney incarnation already has a signature dish in the perfectly simple kingfish carpaccio - served paper thin and drizzled in spicy green chilli dressing.</p> 

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Braised beef honeycomb </h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e3559b239fc7396c138ca4bdc91158c7?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">A trip to Italy served as the unlikely inspiration for a new dish knocking the socks off diners at Lotus, the dumpling emporium at Barangaroo. "When I was in Milan I had an excellent version of braised beef tripe with tomato sauce and parmesan.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">It was just so delicious and gives me goose bumps," says chef Chris yan, who braises his tripe in a stock of cassia bark, star anise, fennel seeds, ShaoXin cooking wine, light soy sauce, palm sugar, ginger and shallots, salt and water.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The meat is then steamed and wok-fried with chilli bean and black bean.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">It is amazing how the beef tripe absorbs all the flavour," he says.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Smoked Trout</h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eedfc08e90bf16896caa45753a81483f?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">If ever there was a dish that heralded a grown up phase it's this elegant take on 'French onion dip n chips' from Sydney's original Americana raconteur Greg Llewellyn who put fried chicken on the menu years before it was a 'thing'.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Here he combines house made French Onion dip, layered with smoked trout and pickled golden beets and sprinkled with fried fish skin, thick home made potato crisps and fish roe - from the Pyrenees no less. Simple. Mature. Divine. Be sure and get a babysitter.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;">Passionfruit, white chocolate and pistachio dacquoise.</h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a2c4443e7c6b205929d5f34f0cb8ede7?width=366" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Because who doesn't love passionfruit? Well, until her relocation from California to Sydney, Fred's head chef Danielle Alvarez who had barely encountered the fruit but is making up for lost time.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">"I realised pretty fast that passionfruit is something Australians love so I had to figure out a way to use it and do it justice," says Alvarez, who decided to infuse a sponge and later with meringue and white chocolate and top with rose petals and roasted pistachios.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:300%;" align="center"><span style="padding-left:68px;"> Champagne Lobster Toast</h2></span>
<br><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c602d6025f5ecaa8f9ad6d37c3f12b6e?width=650" align="center"></br>
<p style="font-size:160%;">There are few restaurants more 'Sydney' than Aria - perched under the haunches of The Toaster at Circular Quay. And since relaunching late last year a new signature dish has emerged. Not a big, brassy steak or some fish wonder but a slice of French toast - with a twist.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">That is - layered with Champagne poached lobster. "The softness of brioche, which we make in house, butter, the acidity of finger limes and the burst of caviar all just worked so beautifully," says Matt Moran.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">"The best quality lobster, French toast, caviar, and finger limes. I think it just ticks a lot of boxes for most people." Say no more.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">What do you like about the dish?</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">It's a well-balanced dish and I just love the simplicity of it - it's literally four ingredients. It's not overly fussy and it just hits the mark. It's one of my personal favourites on the new menu</p>
